# [nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) configuration

| version     | OS             |
|-------------|----------------|
| `0.9.0-dev` | `pop-os 22.04` |

Set path to neovim configurations and make it default editor:
```
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"
export EDITOR='nvim'
```
## installation

#### debian

if you are confident enough embed the [unstable](https://launchpad.net/~neovim-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/unstable) repository.
```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable
sudo apt update
```
and install neovim
```sh
# install directly for old stable version
sudo apt install neovim
```
in addition install python support
```sh
sudo apt install python-neovim
sudo apt install python3-neovim
```
Do `:checkhealth` and see if any clipboard tool is already supported by default.
If not, [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) provides handy functionalities for clipping
```sh
sudo apt install xclip
```
(neovim should detect it automatically)

---

#### \lua

Contains all configuration files to initially! set-up nvim via lua.

#### \meikse

Subfolder should be unique to not interfere downloaded plugins, thus this folder is named after user.
All used files stored in [meikse](./lua/meikse) need to be `required` in [init.lua](./lua/meikse/init.lua).


#### \after

It contains all third-party plugins for further configuration.
In contrast to the files stored in [lua](./lua), files in [after](./after) will be loaded subsequently when [init.lua](./init.lua) is sourced.


#### \plugin

Here tweaking and twisting of the default configurations of those plugins are done.\
Note subfolder [shall](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/x3zp6t/usage_of_afterftplugin_directory_for/) be called plugin (see `:h rtp`).


#### \lsp

All configuration files towards the [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/) server support are stored here. 

#### \cmp

All configuration files towards the [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/) support are stored here. (has nothing to do with nvim-lsp directly)

#### \ftplugin

It can be used to define configurations to a specific filetype.

#### \dict

It contains dictionaries for aimed languages for plain text editing.
The dictionaries are link to unix default dictionaries stored in `/usr/share/dict/`

(only needed for [cmp-dictionary](https://github.com/uga-rosa/cmp-dictionary))

#### \spell

It contains a list of own spell checks for aimed languages.

#### \skeleton

It contains raw templates for different kinds of file formats. (see [autocmd.lua](./lua/meikse/autocmd.lua) for sourcing them automatically)

#### \snippets

It contains self-created snippets for various purposes.


## lsp 

#### pyright

no specific configs. Plug-and-Play.

#### ltex

include language usepackages 
```tex
\usepackage[<language>]{babel}
```
thus the ltex parser identifies which language is shall be evaluated during editing.

#### clangd

> Did not managed to configure for c++ 

set-up in [servers.lua](./after/plugin/lsp/servers.lua)

1. Installed via `:LspInstall` 
2. Installed with `sudo apt install clangd` 

in both cases, `clangd` works for plain `.c` files but is not configurable and thus useable for `.cpp` files

try outs:
1. touched in the root folder `compile_commands.json` and/or `compile_flags.txt` described [here](https://clangd.llvm.org/installation#project-setup) and configured them
2. touched `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clangd/.clangd` with content:
```
CompileFlags:
    Add: [-std=c++14]
```

## Notes
spell check: is good to correct **while/after** you write a word \
Keyword check: lists all words matching with the word **before** using it.


## TODO 

- disable commenting next line if appending line is a comment (seems to be pretty heavy problem. set formatoptions always changes, no matter if init in /after or doing autocmd..
https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/pgtdi1/trouble_with_setting_formatoptions_in_lua/

- config `clangd` for `.cpp` files

- (install telescope)
